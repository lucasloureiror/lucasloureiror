 


## ðŸŒƒ Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is <strong>Lucas!</strong>

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer from Brazil, with a unique background as a former lawyer. Currently, I'm in the final stages of my Information Systems undergraduate program at ICMC-USP in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil.

My expertise spans Cloud (AWS and Azure), distributed systems management, Kubernetes, FinOps, network troubleshooting, and system architecture. I'm passionate about privacy and security in tech.

Recently, I've also been diving into the world of Web3 and blockchain technology. I'm actively developing smart contracts using Solidity, exploring decentralized applications (dApps), and contributing to the growing ecosystem of decentralized technologies.

Feel free to explore my pinned projects below to see what I've been working on. 
For secure communication, you can find my PGP public key on my website.
